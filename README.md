# Simple_MLP

***(Please be patient. This repository is under construction.)***

This repository contains a **basic MLP**, implemented from scratch to demonstrate it's capabilities in comparison to the **logistic regression** as a basline machine learning method across different problems of varying complexity.

The table below presents different classification problems. The objective is to identify separating lines that effectively distinguish between the blue and red dots. The plot displays the resulting regions indicating the color affiliation. These regions are delineated to illustrate the classification outcomes, with distinct areas representing the affiliation of different colors.

The accompanying images illustrate the iterative problem-solving process observed during the neural network's training phase, featuring a selection of sample problems. As training progresses, notable refinements to the decision boundary are evident, ultimately yielding an accuracy rate surpassing 90% for each respective problem scenario.
